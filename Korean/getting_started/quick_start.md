This step by step guide will walk you through the process of launching an Endpoint Node (EN) of Baobab Testnet and building a basic smart contract with your new account. The tutorial consists of two parts, setting up an EN node and deploying a smart contract through your EN. 

# Launch an EN and Add Baobab testnet KLAY to your Account (Linux, Mac)

The first part of this tutorial explains how to launch an EN, create a new account, and top up your account with the faucet in the Baobab KlaytnWallet.
