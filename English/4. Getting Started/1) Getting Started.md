# Getting Started
This step-by-step guide will help you quickly get started with Klaytn.
Klaytn currently maintains two public networks, Cypress (the mainnet) and Baobab (testnet).

This tutorial uses the Baobab testnet because deploying a smart contract and submitting a transaction require transaction fees in KLAY. For the development purpose, testnet KLAY can be obtained from the Baobab faucet. The detailed steps of creating an account and getting testnet KLAY will be provided in the Quick Start section.

This tutorial covers the following learning objective:

​Quick Start: You will install an Endpoint Node (EN) in your local system to connect to the Klaytn network and deploy your first smart contract.

​Accounts: You will learn how to manage Klaytn accounts from the command line using ken and on the JavaScript console.
