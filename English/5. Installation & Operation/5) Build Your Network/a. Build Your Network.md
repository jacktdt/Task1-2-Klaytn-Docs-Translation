Baobab testnet is available to the public, still, you may prefer to build your own network for development or testing purposes. This document explains how to set up your private Klaytn network. Unlike the CC or EN operation guides, this document aims to create a local network in a single host server by running the nodes on different ports. homi tool will be used to generate initial configuration files such as genesis.json, static-nodes.json, and the node keys. The Klaytn helper tool homi is available as source code at Klaytn GitHub. To build the tool, follow the guideline in the repo.
