# Hardware Setup

A Klaytn Core Cell (CC) consists of the following components.

Klaytn Consensus Node (CN)

Klaytn Proxy Node (PN)

Klaytn CN

A node which creates a new block with other CN participants of the Core Cell Network

A network is comprised of the permissioned CNs (Required IP access control).

1 unit

Klaytn PN

- A node which submits transactions received from the Klaytn Endpoint Node Network to a CN or CNs.
 - It propagates the created blocks from a CN or CNs to Klaytn Endpoint Node Network.
 - It may be required to be scaled out horizontally depending on the number of ENs in the Klaytn Endpoint Node Network.

- It is connected with CNs internally in a Core Cell, and its IP and Ports are required to be public to be connected with other Klaytn nodes on the Internet.
 - It can connect to some PNs in the other CCs via a PN bootnode (not implemented yet).
 - It supports connections to an EN or ENs via a EN bootnode (not yet implemented.)

At least 1, but recommended 2 or more for spares.

It is recommended that a Core Cell consists of a CN with 2 or more PNs. A CN is able to be connected to the other CNs within the Core Cell Network, or to PNs in the same Core Cell. A PN is able to be connected to all the ENs within the Klaytn Endpoint Node Network.

Next section describes the hardware specification in order to operate nodes in a Core Cell.

## Klaytn H/W Specification
The network performance is measured based on the worst hardware specification within the network. According to the blockchain network structure, it is only possible to be scaled up vertically (increasing hardware capacity). Hence, it is recommended that all the nodes within the network should have the best hardwares having the similar specifications with each other at least.

The following sections show the recommended specifications for both CNs and PNs.

Server

Intel® Server System R2312WFTZS

Note that this is a recommended hardware specification for CNs and PNs, not an exact requirement. Any physical machine having similar hardware configuration would be sufficient to operate a CN or a PN.
