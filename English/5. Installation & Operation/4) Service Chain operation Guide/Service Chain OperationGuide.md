# Service Chain Operation Guide
Disclaimer: Service Chain is currently under development. We recommend to use it experimentally.

This document describes how to set up and operate a servicechain, and connect with the main chain (Mainnet or Baobab testnet).

The Klaytn network overview is described in CC Operation Guide, Network, and EN Operation Guide.

Briefly, the procedures to set up a servicechain can be separated like as the following:

Setup an EN for main chain (Mainnet or Baobab testnet) refering EN Operation Guide.

Setup your service chain nodes.

Connect the service chain with the main chain.

After this, we will provide how to check if the EN is running successfully or not.
